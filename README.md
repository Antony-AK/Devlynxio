## 🧠 Role of Vercel v0

To accelerate UI creation, **Vercel v0** was used to generate:

- **Impact Section**
- **Testimonials Section**
- **Footer**

These components were then refined and optimized for:

- Branding consistency  
- Responsiveness  
- Accessibility  
- Animation smoothness  
- Performance  

All other components — including the Hero, Navbar, Services, Horizonal Scroll, and Particle Animations — were **custom-built** using React, GSAP, Framer Motion, and Three.js.

## ⚙️ Performance Optimizations

- Lazy-loaded non-critical images  
- Reduced particle counts on mobile  
- Preloaded key hero assets  
- Removed layout shifts (CLS = 0)  
- Optimized GSAP timelines  
- Better scroll performance with Lenis
